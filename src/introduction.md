# Developer Handbook

Welcome to the Developer Handbook, a comprehensive resource crafted to address key technical aspects involved in the
development of information systems. Developed by the
internal [BĮIP](https://github.com/orgs/AplinkosMinisterija/teams/biip) team within the Government of Lithuania, this
handbook aims to shed light on how our team approaches information system development
and infrastructure management.

Our intention is to provide valuable insights to both our existing team members and newcomers, facilitating a deeper
understanding of the technological landscape unique to BĮIP. By sharing our experiences and best practices, we hope to
empower our team members in their roles within the engineering team.

While the primary focus is on guiding BĮIP team members, we acknowledge that this handbook may prove beneficial to other
teams, particularly within the government of Lithuania. However, it's important to note that the practices advocated by
the BĮIP team may not be universally applicable to all teams.

Please be aware that this handbook is an ongoing project, a collaborative effort involving contributions from various
individuals. Many sections are still _under development_. If you are interested in
contributing to this endeavor, we welcome your assistance through pull requests on our GitHub
repository: [Developer Handbook Repository](https://github.com/AplinkosMinisterija/developer-handbook).

Your engagement is invaluable to the enhancement of this resource, and your feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you
for joining us on this journey of continuous improvement in the realm of information system development.
